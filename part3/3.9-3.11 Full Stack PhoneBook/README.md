# Full Stack Phonebook â€“ Backend & Deployed Frontend ðŸŽ‰

This is my Full Stack Phonebook project from Part 3 of the Full Stack Open course. It's a Node.js + Express backend with a React frontend â€” all bundled up and deployed like a proper little web app.

## ðŸ’» How to run it locally

You'll need **two terminals** for dev mode:

### Terminal 1 â€“ Backend

cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Backend
npm install
npm run dev

### Terminal 2 â€“ Frontend
bash
cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
Make sure your frontend is set up to talk to.

Furthermore, the project isn't fully ready yet. I will commit changes as I proceed with the last two remaining sub-chapters of Full-Stack part3.
