# Full Stack Phonebook â€“ Backend & Deployed Frontend

This is my Full Stack Phonebook project from Part 3 of the Full Stack Open course. It's a Node.js + Express backend with a React frontend


ðŸ‘‰ [Check it out on Render](https://full-stack-phonebook-r7l0.onrender.com)


## ðŸ’» How to run it locally

You'll need **two terminals** for dev mode:

### Terminal 1 â€“ Backend

- cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Backend
- npm install
- npm run dev

### Terminal 2 â€“ Frontend

- cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev

Furthermore, the project isn't fully ready yet. I will commit changes as I proceed with the last two remaining sub-chapters of Full-Stack part3.
