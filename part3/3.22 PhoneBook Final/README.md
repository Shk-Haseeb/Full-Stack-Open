# Full Stack Phonebook â€“ Backend & Deployed Frontend

This is my Full Stack Phonebook project from Part 3 of the Full Stack Open course. It's a Node.js + Express backend with a React frontend


ðŸ‘‰ [Check it out on Render](https://phonebook-db-n8h1.onrender.com/)


## ðŸ’» How to run it locally

You'll need **two terminals** for dev mode:

### Terminal 1 â€“ Backend

- cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Backend
- npm install
- npm run dev

### Terminal 2 â€“ Frontend

- cd part3/3.9-3.11\ Full\ Stack\ PhoneBook/Frontend
- npm install
- npm run dev

The Part 3 of Full-Stack-MOOC is now complete and the phonebook is fully operational. However, I am using the free version of Render and website may be unavailable often. Therefore, I have added screenshot of my website here:
